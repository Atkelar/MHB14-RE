# MHB14-RE
MHB 14 - Reel To Reel deck reverse engineering of schematics

## Background
In early 2020, I found an affordable reel to reel tape recorder on e-bay. The model number was MHB 14, a stereo, four track, dual speed, 6mm tape system. Since I always restore such old stuff by cleaning and deoxydizing any contacts/switches and replacing any electrolytic capacitors, I needed to know how the trimmers tie into the circuits and what I would have to adjust for the unit to work again.

## Output
The process of tracing out the contacts from tape head to speaker and from input to tape head resulted in a set of schematics that I believe to be "quite good", but not yet perfect. There are a few open questions and some symbols are just not available in modern schematic design software, so I had to improvise here and there.
